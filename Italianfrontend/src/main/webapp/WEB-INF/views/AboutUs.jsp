        <h3> About Us <h3>
 <h6 style="color:red;"> Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963</h6> 
 <h6 style="color:white;">The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s </h6> 
 <h6 style="color:blue;"> Lamborghini gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports  which established rear mid-engine,
  rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance cars of the era.</h6> 
 <h6 style="color:red;"> Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years,
  but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis.</h6> 
 <h6 style="color:white;"> Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car 
  the LM002 high performance off-road vehicle.</h6>
 
 <h6 style="color:blue;"> The V12-powered Aventador line consists of the LP 700–4 coupé and roadster.</h6> 
 <h6 style="color:red;"> Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 percent.</h6>
 <h6 style="color:white;"> Lamborghini intends to double its car production by producing as many SUVs by 2018 as sports cars.</h6> 
 <h6 style="color:blue;">In the mid-1980s, Lamborghini produced a limited-production run of a 1,000  sports motorcycle.</h6>
 <h6 style="color:red;"> The bodywork was plastic and fully integrated with front fairing merged into fuel tank and
  seat cover ending in a rear tail-fairing. </h6> 
 <h6 style="color:yellow;"> The motorcycles were designed by Lamborghini style and produced by French business Boxer Bikes.</h6>
